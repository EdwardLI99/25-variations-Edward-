    <div class="f2"> <p>Today, <br>
        looking out through dusk <br>
    
    at three gray women in stretch slacks <br>

    chatting in front of the post office, </p></div>

    <!-- 2 -->

    <div class="f3"> <p>their steps left and right and back <br>

    like some quick folk dance of kindness,</p> </div>

    <!-- 3 -->

    <div class="f4"> <p>I remembered the winter we spent <br>

    crying in each other’s laps. <br>

    What could you be thinking at this moment? </p> </div>

    <!-- 4 -->

   <div class="f5"> <p> How lovely and strange the gangly spines <br>

    of trees against a thickening sky <br>

    as you drive from the library <br>

    humming off-key? </p> </div> 

    <!-- 5 -->
    
    <div class="f6"> <p>Or are you smiling <br>

    at an idea met in a book <br>

    the way you smiled with your whole body <br>

    the first night we talked?</p> </div>

    <!-- 6 -->

    <div class="f7"> <p>I was so sure my love of you was perfect, <br>

    and the light today <br>

    reminded me of the winter you drove home  <br>

    each day in the dark at four o’clock <br>

    and would come into my study to kiss me </p> </div>

    <!-- 7 -->

   <div class="f8"> <p>despite mistake after mistake after mistake.</p>  </div>
